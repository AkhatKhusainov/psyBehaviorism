This study proposes an approach that overcomes these limitations through large language model (LLM) reflectionâ€”the ability to analyze its own errors and adjust classification criteria. Unlike traditional methods requiring manual coding and triangulation [11], our technology automates the process while preserving decision transparency.

Behavior prediction is achieved through qualitative analysis of texts at any scale, leveraging large language models' capabilities for interpretation and reflection via iterative dialogue.
